# Pizza Parlor
#### Independent project #4 for Epicodus

#### By Sofia Acosta
## Project Description
This is my indepentent project to showcase the lesson learned last week: Object oriented Javascript. This website is a pizza parlor where a user can choose one or more individual toppings(cheese, pepperoni,artichoke, anchovy,etc) and a size to see the total cost of pizza and then order! 
## Specs
 
```
Describe: Pizza
Test: "create an object pizza with toppings,size and price properties"
Expect(Pizza).toEqual(this.toppings=toppings, this.size=size. this.price=o);

Describe: toppings
Test: "should gather information from user of toppings selected in form"
Expect(Pizza.toppings).toEqual("blackOlives", "onions");

Describe: size
Test: "should gather information from user of toppings selected in form"
Expect(Pizza.size).toEqual("small");

Describe: prices

## Known Bugs
* No known bugs
## Notes
* I wanted to create an array of the topping items from the checkbox. [This gave me the answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16170828/jquery-get-values-of-checked-checkboxes-into-array)
* It was possible to generate the total cost of pizza by adding data price values per item in form. [This article helped!](https://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-to-add-values-from-checkboxes), [and this one too!](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox)
